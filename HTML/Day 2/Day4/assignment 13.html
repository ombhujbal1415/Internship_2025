        Block elements (like <div> and <p>) take up the full width of their container 
        and start on a new line. Inline elements (like <span>) do not start on a new line 
        and only take up as much width as necessary.

    <div>

    <!-- Inline element <span> highlighting one word in blue inside a paragraph -->
    <p>This is a paragraph with one <span class="blue-word">blue</span> word.</p>
